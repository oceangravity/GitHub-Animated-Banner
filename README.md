# GitHub-Animated-Banner
Animate your GitHub Contribution Calendar with a fancy animated banner (for Seniors)

Just for fun!

# How to use?
Copy the script into the console and call the function:

```
githubBanner("â™¥")

```

# Contributions?
As my contribution calendar is not fully filled, I am not a senior, which makes me quite lazy, so I haven't completed all the characters, only the characters necessary to write: BE HUMBLE. PRs accepted!
